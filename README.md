# strava-heatmap-to-kmz

Generate KMZ files from the [Strava Global Heatmap](http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/). This allows you to use the heatmap as a map layer (currently 1000Ã—1000 pixels) on a mobile device (e.g. iPhone or Garmin), which enables offline use and helps you to locate where the hell you are in the woods.

## Dependencies

-   Node.js
-   NPM

## Usage

`npm run start -- <lat> <lon> <sessionID> [colorFlag]`

The `--` end of options flag is important, because it allows for negative numbers in coordinates.
`sessionID` can be found when logged into to a Strava session. It is the `_strava4_session` cookie.
For example:

`npm run start -- 42.32733,-72.70095 stravasessionid108`

`colorFlag` sets the color of the heatmap trace. If none is provided, defaults to 'gray'
|optional flag|result|
|---|-------|
| h | "hot" |
| r | "red" |
| b | "blue" |
| g | "gray" |
| p | "purple" |

## How it works

The program loads the Strava Heatmap in a headless puppeteer browser and takes a snapshot of the page and saves the map bounds. It then constructs a KML file declaring an image overlay positioned using the map bounds loaded previously. It then zips up this KML file along with the snapshot image, creating a KMZ that can be used in Google Earth and other programs. KMZ files are saved in the same directory as the script, with the convention of `<lat>-<lon>heatmap.kmz`.

## TODO

-   Use proper CLI option parsing
-   Make map size configurable
-   Allow for declared output path
